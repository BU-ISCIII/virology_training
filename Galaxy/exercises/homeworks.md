Once you've learn how to analyze SARS-CoV-2 data from your local computer, we want you to analyze a different sample of SARS-CoV-2 data with this URL:

```
https://zenodo.org/record/5718923/files/SARSCOV2-2_R1.fastq.gz?download=1
https://zenodo.org/record/5718923/files/SARSCOV2-2_R2.fastq.gz?download=1
```

### Now you have to follow the Galaxy training at home and answer the following questions:

1. How many variants does the sample SARSCOV2-2 have?
2. Which lineage is assigned by pangolin to this sample?
