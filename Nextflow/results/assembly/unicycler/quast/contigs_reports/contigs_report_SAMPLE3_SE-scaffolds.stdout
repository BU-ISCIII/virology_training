CONTIG: 1 (25442bp)
Best alignment score: 16860.3 (LEN: 16862, IDY: 99.99), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 25412.0, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 0
		This contig is misassembled.
			Excluding internal overlap of size 7 between Alignment 1 and 2: 94 8680 | 1 8587 | 8587 8587 --> 94 8673 | 1 8580 | 8580 8580
			Real Alignment 1: 94 8673 | 1 8580 | 8580 8580 | 99.99 | NC_045512.2 1
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = 199 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 12936 29797 | 8581 25442 | 16862 16862 | 99.99 | NC_045512.2 1

CONTIG: 2 (3984bp)
Best alignment score: 3982.8 (LEN: 3984, IDY: 99.97), Total number of alignments: 1
		One align captures most of this contig: 8952 12935 | 3984 1 | 3984 3984 | 99.97 | NC_045512.2 2
