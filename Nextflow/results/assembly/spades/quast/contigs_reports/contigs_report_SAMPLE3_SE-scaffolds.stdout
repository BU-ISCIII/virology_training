Best alignment score: 16897.3 (LEN: 16899, IDY: 99.99), Total number of alignments: 2
			Looking for the best set of alignments (out of 2 total alignments)
			The best set is below. Score: 25511.9, number of alignments: 2, unaligned bases: 26
		This contig is misassembled.
			Excluding internal overlap of size 7 between Alignment 1 and 2: 31 8680 | 1 8650 | 8650 8650 --> 31 8673 | 1 8643 | 8643 8643
			Real Alignment 1: 31 8673 | 1 8643 | 8643 8643 | 99.99 | NC_045512.2 NODE_1_length_25568_cov_259.339452
			  Gap between these two alignments (local misassembly). Inconsistency = 99 [linear representation of circular genome]
			Real Alignment 2: 12936 29834 | 8644 25542 | 16899 16899 | 99.99 | NC_045512.2 NODE_1_length_25568_cov_259.339452

CONTIG: NODE_2_length_5513_cov_4.136836 (5513bp)
